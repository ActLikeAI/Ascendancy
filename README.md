# Ascendancy Explorer

Ascendancy Explorer is a tool for exploring art assets from Ascendancy. As such, it is totally useless if you don’t have the game. However, it doesn’t need to be installed; the installation CD would also do the trick. At the moment it supports images (shp & tmp), music (raw), sound effects (voc & raw) and movies (flc). It is also possible to convert all the supported files to more common formats (i.e. shp to png or raw to wav).

At the first run, application will ask you for the location of the Ascendancy game folder. If you would rather set it later, you can do it by selecting Select Directory in the File menu. Other options in the File menu are Extract All and Extract & Convert All. The first one will extract all the data to the selected directory in their original form, and the second will also convert all supported formats.
